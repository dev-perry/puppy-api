# Puppy API

This is a simple API that I am using to practice creating cloud deployments.

I may update this repository from time to to time to test different configurations before integrating them into my other projects.

Feel free to use this for your own deployment practice. A successful deployment should be able to:

1. Install necessary environment dependencies
2. Start the FastAPI server with uvicorn
3. Receive requests and return responses

I am using the following technologies in my deployment workflow:

- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
